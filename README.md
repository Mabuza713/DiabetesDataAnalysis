## Project Overview

The project connects to a SQL Server database, fetches data, preprocesses it, and builds a linear regression model to predict diabetes. The dataset includes various health indicators such as BMI, blood pressure, and cholesterol levels.

## Features

- Connects to a SQL Server database to fetch data.
- Preprocesses data by converting columns to appropriate data types.
- Splits the data into training and testing sets.
- Builds a linear regression model.
- Calculates the possibility of diabetes based on the health indicators.
